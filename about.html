        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
            <h3>PhD in Particle Physics</h3>
            Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain — <em>09/2019 – 03/2025</em><br>
            Under the supervision of Luca Scodellaro, I successfully presented my thesis:<br>
            <a href="https://repository.cern/records/yp9bn-yxp47" target="_blank">
                "Search For Supersymmetric Particle Pair Production In Final States With Two Oppositely Charged
                Leptons And Large Missing Transverse Momentum In Proton-proton Collisions At 13 TeV"
            </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                This effort involved applying several data analysis techniques on high-energy experiment datasets, using
                AI tools and distributed computing with numerous parallel jobs on a large cluster.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h3>M.Sc. in Particle Physics</h3>
            Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain — <em>09/2017 – 09/2018</em><br>
            I specialised in a masters in physics, where I not only learnt about particle physics but also several machine learning tools. I successfully defended my master thesis, titled:<br>
            <a href="https://repositorio.unican.es/xmlui/handle/10902/16279" target="_blank">
             "Higgs production cross section at 13 TeV and prospects on BSM searches for the HL-LHC"  </a>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) in Physics</h3>
                Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain — <em>01/2013 – 01/2017</em><br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h3>International Exchanges</h3>
                During my studies I also participated in several exchange programs that enhanced my international
                perspective, including:

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Aside from my career,  I am bilingual in Spanish and English, with some knowledge on French (B2) and Italian (B1). Likewise, exposure to different educational and professional environments has developed my ability to navigate multicultural contexts with ease. In addition, I enjoy immersing myself in geopolitical and economic issues, frequently analyzing and interpreting raw data to form my own perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also practised several sports competitive, including waterpolo and triathlon during my university years, as well as padel, which allowed me to develop my teamwork abilities, as well as to deal better with effort.
